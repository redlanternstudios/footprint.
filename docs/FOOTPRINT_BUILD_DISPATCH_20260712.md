# Footprint Autonomous Authority Engine Build Dispatch

Version: 1.0
Date: 2026 07 12
Owner: Ro
Implementer: Codex
Status: SUPERSEDED BY SWARMCLAW BUILD BRIEF DATED 2026 07 13

## Mission

Build and commission Footprint so it operates fully autonomously from its first public day while remaining unable to publish outside verified identity, evidence, product, community, privacy, and platform authority.

## Build order

The build order is mandatory. Publisher work cannot begin before the authority and decision gates pass.

## Phase 0: Register the product and lane

### User story

As Ro, I want Footprint registered in Claudex so every engine shares one current lane, receipt chain, warning set, and next action.

### Work

1. Add Footprint to the durable product registry.
2. Add a bridge product entry through the validated command layer or a versioned bridge schema change.
3. Open lane `footprint/authority_registry`.
4. Record this scope lock and architecture as lane inputs.
5. Preserve The Lantern lane state without closing or rewriting it.

### Gate

Bridge validation and doctor pass with a real receipt.

## Phase 1: Authority Registry and policy compiler

### User story

As the autonomous engine, I need machine readable authority before I generate or publish anything so uncertainty cannot become public speech.

### Work

1. Create Supabase migrations for identities, consent, products, capabilities, evidence, claims, policies, channels, permissions, and policy versions.
2. Enable RLS before data insertion.
3. Build n8n Claudex ingestion for bridge and consumers.
4. Build receipt normalization with explicit claim scope.
5. Build evidence freshness and expiry.
6. Compile immutable rules from the registry contract.
7. Seed Ro, RedLantern, Keymon, and Kevin as separate disabled identities.
8. Seed current products from the bridge with claim ceilings.
9. Build policy conflict detection.
10. Build a machine query returning active authority.

### Tests

1. Bridge overrides stale memory.
2. Unknown consent denies publication.
3. Lantern founder promotion rejects.
4. Authentic Hadith without scholarly evidence quarantines.
5. TradeSwarm readiness rejects while Blocked.
6. Keymon and Kevin cannot merge.
7. Private evidence never enters the public projection.

### Gate

Every immutable rule test passes. No publisher code exists before this gate.

## Phase 2: Capability graph and evidence lineage

### User story

As Footprint, I need a current model of what the studio can truthfully claim so I can highlight the whole capability estate without overstating prototypes or exposing private work.

### Work

1. Normalize capability families across Claudex, QuietBuild, SwarmClaw, RobbyPA, Amina, Authentic Hadith, The Lantern, TradeSwarm, HireWire, Deixis, Mission Esthetics, Paradise, ByRed Daily OS, and verified studio operations.
2. Link every capability to products, identities, evidence, public boundary, freshness, and maturity.
3. Separate repo existence from capability proof.
4. Create public safe summaries.
5. Create claim ceilings per maturity state.
6. Create conflict and staleness queues.
7. Create graph queries for identity, audience, product, geography, and topic views.

### Gate

Every active public capability has at least one current evidence record and a claim ceiling. Unsupported capabilities remain disabled.

## Phase 3: Audience, geography, and opportunity engine

### User story

As Ro, I want the engine to pursue a small, relevant set of people and circles rather than broadcasting broadly.

### Work

1. Create people, organization, circle, market cell, topic, and relationship state tables.
2. Store only professional public data and approved private relationship notes.
3. Record provenance and deletion paths.
4. Create the first audience circles.
5. Create market cells with time zone, local context, institutions, events, and service relevance.
6. Build signal ingestion from approved sources.
7. Build opportunity scoring.
8. Build relevance explanations.
9. Build cold start fixed budgets.
10. Build audience fatigue and topic fatigue signals.

### Gate

Each opportunity explains the intended person or circle, identity, evidence, geographic relevance, timing, value, risk, and desired outcome.

## Phase 4: Editorial and claim verification engine

### User story

As Footprint, I need to create identity specific original work and verify every public claim before any channel receives it.

### Work

1. Create identity voice policies.
2. Create content format policies per channel.
3. Generate separate assets per identity and audience purpose.
4. Extract every factual claim from generated content.
5. Resolve every claim to evidence.
6. Reject unsupported or over ceiling language.
7. Detect similarity to recent content.
8. Apply privacy and intellectual property filters.
9. Apply cultural and religious gates.
10. Produce final content plus a decision explanation and evidence bundle.

### Gate

One hundred commissioning cases run. Catastrophic boundary accuracy is one hundred percent. Overall claim classification accuracy is at least ninety eight percent.

## Phase 5: Saturation Governor

### User story

As Ro, I want controlled presence that compounds authority without making the portfolio feel repetitive, coordinated, or desperate.

### Work

1. Implement shared identity and circle budgets.
2. Enforce topic rest periods.
3. Enforce source event reuse limits.
4. Prevent identical text.
5. Track proof to opinion ratio.
6. Reduce budgets after weak qualified outcomes.
7. Freeze on negative trust or platform signals.
8. Permit bounded growth only after sustained quality.

### Gate

Adversarial tests prove that simultaneous eligible content cannot exceed identity, circle, topic, and portfolio budgets.

## Phase 6: Owned media and search authority

### User story

As RedLantern, I need permanent owned proof so authority survives social platform changes.

### Work

1. Verify canonical ownership and deployment for RorySemeah.com and the RedLantern studio site.
2. Register public proof templates.
3. Build case study and capability page updates.
4. Build Organization and person structured data.
5. Build internal linking and sitemap updates.
6. Require unique evidence and reader value for every new page.
7. Add no index to unproven or review state assets.
8. Build Search Console measurement where authorized.
9. Build correction and rollback.

### Gate

At least one owned adapter publishes, verifies, rolls back, and records a receipt without human approval.

## Phase 7: Official social channel adapters

### User story

As Footprint, I need each social account to activate only for actions its official authorization permits.

### Work

1. Register LinkedIn application and requested products.
2. Record permission status per account and action.
3. Test organization publication separately from personal publication.
4. Store tokens outside the repository.
5. Build token health and refresh.
6. Build idempotent publish, edit, delete, and analytics actions only where permitted.
7. Deny scraping and browser automation.
8. Preserve content in the queue when an adapter is disabled.
9. Add future adapters only through versioned policy and scope changes.

### Gate

Each desired adapter has a receipt marked Active or Denied. No Unknown adapter can receive content.

## Phase 8: Outcome and relationship intelligence

### User story

As Ro, I want Footprint to learn from qualified authority movement, not vanity metrics.

### Work

1. Collect publication outcomes.
2. Tag qualified people and organizations.
3. Record conversation, referral, invitation, hiring, partnership, and client outcomes.
4. Attribute proof asset consumption.
5. Update relationship states.
6. Recalibrate opportunity and saturation weights within bounded limits.
7. Prevent impressions from directly increasing publication volume.
8. Write weekly Claudex reports.

### Gate

Every strategy change states the business question, evidence, old value, new value, and rollback condition.

## Phase 9: Recovery, security, and commissioning

### User story

As Ro, I need the engine to fail quietly, recover safely, and stop instantly when a real boundary is threatened.

### Work

1. Build global and adapter kill switches.
2. Build retry with idempotency.
3. Build dead letter and exception queues.
4. Build correction and retraction.
5. Build policy rollback.
6. Build token expiry isolation.
7. Build Sentry context and PostHog critical events.
8. Run concurrency, duplicate, provider failure, stale evidence, private data, and policy conflict tests.
9. Run the complete commissioning suite.
10. Write the autonomous activation receipt.

### Gate

All commissioning conditions in `OPS/FOOTPRINT_CTP_ARCHITECTURE_20260712.md` pass.

## Phase 10: Autonomous activation

### User story

As Ro, I want the commissioned engine to operate without routine involvement from its first public day.

### Work

1. Activate only identities with current consent.
2. Activate only channels with verified permission.
3. Activate conservative initial budgets.
4. Begin autonomous signal, decision, publication, measurement, and recovery loops.
5. Write daily machine status and weekly strategy reports to Claudex.
6. Notify humans only for named authority exceptions or material incidents.

### Seven day proof gate

1. Zero unsupported claims.
2. Zero policy breaches.
3. Zero duplicate publications.
4. Zero routine approvals.
5. Zero unofficial platform actions.
6. Every public asset has complete evidence lineage.
7. Every failure has a recorded outcome and recovery state.

## Definition of done

Footprint is complete only when all phases pass, the activation receipt exists, the engine runs for seven days without routine approval or trust incident, and the first qualified outcome report is written to Claudex.

## Single next action

Open `footprint/authority_registry` in the bridge and implement Phase 1 before any publisher or content generation work.
